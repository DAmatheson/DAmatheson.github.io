	            <h1>Capstone Project - Curling Combine</h1>
                
	            <p>
	                As part of my final term I worked on a 4 month capstone project as a team of two for 
                    a client. Our project was supported by the Ontario Curling Council and Curling Canada.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our project is a collection of web-based components that provide mobilized data entry of 
                    athlete performance data specific to curling (short making, brushing, fitness data, etc).
                    The mobilized data entry is accomplished via a mobile application rather than a website 
                    due to the requirement of offline usage. In addition to performance data entry, 
                    there is also an administration management side for athletes, coaches, and teams. 
                    Finally in order to facilitate organizing camps to collect performance data, there 
                    is a component for athlete registration and curling camp management. The entire 
                    system was created to enable future expansion into analytic reporting on athlete 
                    performance data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The backend technology being used was Java, WildFly 10 as the Java EE application server,
                    SQL Server 2014, and Keycloak for security needs. All data access is accomplished via 
                    secured JAX-RS endpoints. For the front end, we used AngularJS and Foundation for
                    Apps. To package the mobilized data entry application we used Apache Cordova.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We utilized both Maven and Grunt to accomplish specific build and development tasks 
                    such as dependency management, packing all the components into an EAR, compiling our SCSS 
                    down into CSS, auto-prefixing CSS with vendor specific prefixes, adding new script files to
                    the home HTML page, and automatically rebuilding and deploying the EAR when front-end files 
                    are modified.
