				<p>Hello potential future employer,</p>
                
                <p>My name is Drew Matheson, and I am currently a first year Computer Programmer/Analyst
                student at Conestoga College. So far during the first year I have learned how to create
                websites with HTML and CSS, and I also learned how to create Windows forms and
                console applications with C# in Visual Studio 2012.</p>
                
                <p>I find programming to be a very rewarding process as you get to both see and shape the development
                and evolution of programs. The sense of accomplishment when you successfully implement
                a tricky new feature or learn a new way to simplify a problem is unlike anything else.</p>
                
                <p>I first began programming at the start of 2012. I was inspired by the developers of one of my
                favourite websites, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/">Giant Bomb</a> to learn programming. One of them
                suggested checking out the book <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>
                as a good starting point for novice programmers. I worked my way through all of the exercises in the book
                during the first half of the year and came away with the ability to program in Python, develop websites, 
                and create a simple web server using the web.py web framework.</p>
                
                <p>At that point I decided I need to get back into school so I enrolled in Conestoga's academic upgrading
                offerings at their Waterloo campus. I finished the communication and math classes required for getting into
                the CPA program in May of 2013. Fast Forward to present and I am currently studying at Conestoga.</p>
