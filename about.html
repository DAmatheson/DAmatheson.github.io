	            <p>Hello potential future employer,</p>
                
	            <p>
	                My name is Drew Matheson, and I am currently a second year Computer Programmer/Analyst
	                student at Conestoga College. So far, I've learned C#, HTML/CSS/Javascript, PHP, SQL
	                and database design in Microsoft Access. I also learned about networking and systems 
	                analysis. In fall 2014 I will be learning systems design, ASP.NET MVC, more object 
                    oriented C#, and additional database and SQL in MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
	            </p>
                     
	            <p>
                    During my first year I learned how to create Windows forms and console applications 
	                with C# in Visual Studio. Furthermore, I learned how to create websites with HTML, 
	                CSS, Javascript, and PHP. Finally, I also learned about database design and created 
                    data entry forms for databases in Microsoft Access.
	            </p>
                
	            <p>
	                I find programming to be a very rewarding process as you get to both see and shape the 
	                development and evolution of programs. The sense of accomplishment when you 
	                successfully implement a tough new feature or find way to simplify a problem
	                is very rewarding.
	            </p>
                
	            <p>
	                I first began programming at the start of 2012. I was inspired by the developers of one 
	                of my favourite websites, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/">Giant Bomb</a> to learn 
	                programming. One of them suggested checking out the book 
	                <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> as a good 
	                starting point for novice programmers. I worked my way through all of the exercises in 
	                the book during the first half of the year and came away with the ability to program 
	                in Python, develop websites, and create a simple web server using the web.py  
                    framework.
	            </p>
                
	            <p>
	                At that point I decided I need to get back into school so I enrolled in Conestoga's 
	                academic upgrading offerings at their Waterloo campus. I finished the communication 
	                and math classes required for getting into the CPA program in May of 2013. Fast 
                    forward to present and I am currently studying at Conestoga.
