                        <p>
                            The first two projects were to create a website for a bus service. This
                            included create, view, edit, and delete pages for bus routes, stops, trips,
                            and trip stops.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            The third assignment involved hand creating pages using HTML helpers.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            The fourth assignment was to create a self-validating model and other 
                            related validations.
                        </p>
                            
                        <p>
                            The final assignment was based around users and roles. This included
                            restricting portions of the website to specific roles and creating an
                            administration section for managing the users and roles.

	                    <p>
	                        The final project for my Object Oriented Game Programming classed required us
                            to create a game that fulfilled some basic requirements and optionally included
                            extra enhancements. My partner and I decided to recreate the flash game Helicopter.
                            In the game you control a side-scrolling helicopter trying to avoid crashing into
                            obstacles or hitting the top or bottom of the cave. The only control you have over
                            the helicopter is to make it fly up. The game tracks the top five high scores which
                            are based on the distance traveled before crashing.

                        <h3>Two Player Pong</h3>
	                    <div class="imageCenter">
	                        <a href="Static/Images/Pong.jpg">
	                            <img src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Pong_thumb.jpg"

	                        </a>
	                    </div>
	                    <p>
	                        This was a simple two player pong game created in XNA. I created a base class
                            for a sprite and inherited from it for the ball, paddle, and score board. For
                            handling collision, I created an ICollidable interface which the ball and paddle
                            implemented. I then created a collision manager which looped through a collection
                            of ICollidables to see if they intersected each other. If they did, the colliding
                            objects would be notified via the OnCollision method of ICollidable.

                        <h3>Sliding Puzzle Game</h3>
	                    <div class="imageCenter">

	                        </a>
	                    </div>
	                    <p>
	                        This project required me to make a sliding puzzle game that can have its
                            length and width customized by the player. Additionally, the game has 
                            save and loading functionality. I accomplished this by inheriting the Button
                            class, adding location properties, and swap and animation methods. To checked
                            if the game has been won, I loop through all of the boxes and check if they are
                            all in their correct positions.

	                    <p>
	                        This was my final project for my first term C# class. I had to create
	                        a reservation system for an airline system or concert. The biggest
	                        challenges presented when developing this program were creating an
	                        error-resistant file reading and saving system and assigning seats
	                        to each button in such a way that it would be simple to expand the
	                        number of seats.

	                    <p>
	                        My first term C# class had a group project which required us to make a
	                        game that would review the chapter questions in a fun way. My team decided
	                        to create a mix of Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe. For this project I created
	                        the question window and the question result window. On the code side of
	                        things, I created a question class for setting up the questions. I put
	                        all of the questions into a list which the game randomly picked and removed
	                        a question from so that questions didn't repeat.

	                    <p>
	                        For this project, I had to create an application that allowed the user to
	                        input their gender, activity level, and weight. The number of calories required
	                        to maintain their current weight is then calculated and displayed.

	                    <p>
	                        My final HTML project was to create a portfolio website. The website you are
	                        currently seeing is the result. I created this site from scratch. As I prefer
	                        white text on darker pages over black text on lighter pages, I went with that
	                        style for my own site. Furthermore, I limited the text to the middle section of
	                        the page to help with readability. Overall, I'm very happy with the results.

	                        the page as a way to experiment with it and learn about both it and responsive
	                        layouts.
