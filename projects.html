                <div id="flightReservation">
                    <h2>Flight Reservation System</h2>
                    <p>This is my final project for my first term C# class. I had to create
                    a reservation system for an airline system, concert, etc. The biggest 
                    challenges presented when developing this program were creating an
                    error-resistant file reading and saving system, and assigning a seat
                    to each button in such a way that it would be simple to expand the
                    number of seats with relative ease.

                <div id="chapterReviewGame">
                    <h2>Chapter Review Game</h2>
                    <p>The C# class had a group project which required us to make a game
                    that would review the chapter questions in a fun way. My team decided
                    to create a mix of Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe. For this project I created
                    the question window and the question result window. On the code side of
                    things, I created a question class for setting up the questions. I put
                    all of the questions into a list which the game randomly picked and removed
                    a question from so that questions didn't repeat.</p>

				<div id="calorieCalculator">
                    <h2>Calorie Calculator</h2>
                    <p>For this project I had to create an application that calculated the
                    number of calories required to maintain your current weight based on 
                    pre-defined calories per pound factors.</p>
