                <div id="flightReservation">
                    <h2>Flight Reservation System</h2>
                    <a href="Static/Images/Reservation_System.jpg"><img class="imgCenter"
                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Reservation_System_thumb.jpg"

                    <p>This is my final project for my first term C# class. I had to create
                    a reservation system for an airline system or concert. The biggest 
                    challenges presented when developing this program were creating an
                    error-resistant file reading and saving system, and assigning seats
                    to each button in such a way that it would be simple to expand the
                    number of seats.

                <div id="chapterReviewGame">
                    <h2>Chapter Review Game</h2>
                    <a href="Static/Images/Game.jpg"><img class="imgCenter"
                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Game_thumb.jpg"
                        alt="Review Game Screenshot" height="250" width="405" /></a>
                    <p>The C# class had a group project which required us to make a game
                    that would review the chapter questions in a fun way. My team decided
                    to create a mix of Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe. For this project I created
                    the question window and the question result window. On the code side of
                    things, I created a question class for setting up the questions. I put
                    all of the questions into a list which the game randomly picked and removed
                    a question from so that questions didn't repeat.</p>

                    <h2>Calorie Calculator</h2>

                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Calorie_Calculator_thumb.jpg"
                        alt="Calorie Calculator Screenshot" height="250" width="404" /></a>
                    <p>For this project I had to create an application that allowed the user to 
                    input their gender, activity level, and weight. The number of calories required
                    to maintain their current weight is then calculated and displayed.</p>
