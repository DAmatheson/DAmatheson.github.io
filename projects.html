				        My final HTML projects was to create a portfolio website. The website you are
				        currently seeing is the result. I created this site from scratch. As I prefer
				        white text on darker pages over black text on lighter pages, I went with that
				        style for my own site. Furthermore, I limited the text to the middle section of
				        the page to help with readability. Overall, I'm very happy with the results.

                    <p>
                        This was my final project for my first term C# class. I had to create
                        a reservation system for an airline system or concert. The biggest 
                        challenges presented when developing this program were creating an
                        error-resistant file reading and saving system and assigning seats
                        to each button in such a way that it would be simple to expand the
                        number of seats.

                    <p>
                        My first term C# class had a group project which required us to make a
                        game that would review the chapter questions in a fun way. My team decided
                        to create a mix of Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe. For this project I created
                        the question window and the question result window. On the code side of
                        things, I created a question class for setting up the questions. I put
                        all of the questions into a list which the game randomly picked and removed
                        a question from so that questions didn't repeat.

                        </a>

				    <p>
				        For this project, I had to create an application that allowed the user to 
				        input their gender, activity level, and weight. The number of calories required
				        to maintain their current weight is then calculated and displayed.

                    <p>
                        This project was our way of showing all the different options available with
                        jQuery UI accordion menus. Each page has demo code that can be copy pasted into
                        a file to mess around with yourself.

                    <p>
                        This project required me to use PHP to add data from web forms into an
                        Access database. After the project was finished, I integrated jQuery mobile into
                        the page as a way to experiment with it and learn about both it and responsive 
                        layouts.
