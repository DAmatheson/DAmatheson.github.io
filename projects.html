					<h2>This Website</h2>
					<p>My final HTML projects was to create a portfolio website. The website you are
					currently seeing is the result. I created this site from scratch. As I prefer
					white text on darker pages over black text on lighter pages, I went with that
                    style for my own site. Furthermore, I limited the text to the middle section of
                    the page to help with readability. Overall, I'm very happy with the results.</p>

                <div id="flightReservation">
                    <h2>Flight Reservation System</h2>
					<div class="imageCenter">
                    <a href="Static/Images/Reservation_System.jpg"><img
                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Reservation_System_thumb.jpg"
                        alt="Flight Reservation Screenshot" height="250" width="286" /></a></div>
                    <p>This was my final project for my first term C# class. I had to create
                    a reservation system for an airline system or concert. The biggest 
                    challenges presented when developing this program were creating an
                    error-resistant file reading and saving system and assigning seats
                    to each button in such a way that it would be simple to expand the
                    number of seats.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="chapterReviewGame">
                    <h2>Chapter Review Game</h2>
					<div class="imageCenter">
                    <a href="Static/Images/Game.jpg"><img
                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Game_thumb.jpg"
                        alt="Review Game Screenshot" height="250" width="405" /></a></div>
                    <p>My first term C# class had a group project which required us to make a
                    game that would review the chapter questions in a fun way. My team decided
                    to create a mix of Connect 4 and tic-tac-toe. For this project I created
                    the question window and the question result window. On the code side of
                    things, I created a question class for setting up the questions. I put
                    all of the questions into a list which the game randomly picked and removed
                    a question from so that questions didn't repeat.</p>

                    <h2>Calorie Calculator</h2>
					<div class="imageCenter">
                    <a href="Static/Images/Calorie_Calculator.jpg"><img
                        src="Static/Images/Thumbnails/Calorie_Calculator_thumb.jpg"
                        alt="Calorie Calculator Screenshot" height="250" width="404" /></a></div>
                    <p>For this project, I had to create an application that allowed the user to 
                    input their gender, activity level, and weight. The number of calories required
                    to maintain their current weight is then calculated and displayed.</p>

                <div id="jquery-Accordion">
                    <h2>jQuery Accordions</h2>
                    <div class="imageCenter">
                        <a href="Accordion/">jQuery Accordion Menu Demo Site</a>
                    </div>
                    <p>This project was our way of showing all the different options available with
                        jQuery UI accordion menus. Each page has demo code that can be copy pasted into
                        a file to mess around with yourself.
